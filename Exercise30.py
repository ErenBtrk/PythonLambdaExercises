'''
30. Write a Python program to sort a given matrix in
ascending order according to the sum of its rows using lambda.
Original Matrix:
[[1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 5], [1, 1, 1]]
Sort the said matrix in ascending order according to the sum of its rows
[[1, 1, 1], [1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 5]]
Original Matrix:
[[1, 2, 3], [-2, 4, -5], [1, -1, 1]]
Sort the said matrix in ascending order according to the sum of its rows
[[-2, 4, -5], [1, -1, 1], [1, 2, 3]]

def sortMatrix(list):
    return sorted(list,key = lambda x : sum(x))

matrix1 = [[1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 5], [1, 1, 1]]
matrix2 = [[1, 2, 3], [-2, 4, -5], [1, -1, 1]]

print(sortMatrix(matrix1))
print(sortMatrix(matrix2))
